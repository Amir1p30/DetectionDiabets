# instruction :
* this project can detection diabets
* the goal of this project to use type of algorithm from machine learning
* i use 4 of best algorithms in classification you can see the result 

## what libraries did i use ?
1. numpy
1. pandas
1. sikitlearn ( imput & tree & liner_moler & model_selection & ensemble & preprocessing)

### problem in project ?
* actully this project is ready to run but if you have any problem in your system please try google colab -> [google_colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

### if you want to try these algorithm one by one :
```python
model = 'your algorithm'
model.fit(x_train,y_train)
result = model.predict(x_test,y_test)
print(result)

```
