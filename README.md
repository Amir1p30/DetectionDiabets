# Diabetes Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to build a machine learning model for detecting diabetes based on several features. The project utilizes four different algorithms to compare and evaluate their performance.

## Libraries Used
1. numpy
2. pandas
3. scikit-learn (impute, tree, linear_model, model_selection, ensemble, preprocessing)

## Known Issues
This project is ready to run. However, if you encounter any issues running it on your local system, we recommend trying Google Colab for a smoother experience. You can access it here: [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)

## Running the Algorithms
If you want to try each algorithm one by one, use the following template:

```python
model = 'your_algorithm'  # Replace 'your_algorithm' with the actual model (e.g., LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier)
model.fit(x_train, y_train)  # Train the model with the training data
result = model.predict(x_test)  # Predict the outcomes on test data
print(result)  # Output the predictions
